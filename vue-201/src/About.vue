    Two users agree on three words for the conversation. One of the users enters
    the three words and sends a message. The message is encrypted using the
    three words and sent to the server. The server holds the message, no one is
    listening. The second user does the same thing. Now the server knows which
    two users want to talk. The second user gets the message from the 1st user
    and the 1st user gets the message from the second user.

  <p>How does the server push to the user? How does WebSockets work?</p>
